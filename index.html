            <p>Computer Science Student</p>
            <p>I am an older student intentionally rebuilding my career through computer
            science. I focus on practical skills, strong fundamentals, and
            consistent progress rather than shortcuts.</p>

        <!-- About section:background and career focus -->
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I’m currently studying computer science with an emphasis on learning
                how systems work and how to apply that knowledge to real problems.
                As an older student, I bring discipline, focus, and a strong sense
                of ownership to my work. I don’t take learning opportunities lightly
                and prefer building things that are clear, functional, and easy
                to improve over time.</p>
